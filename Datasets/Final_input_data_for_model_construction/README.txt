Features explanation

#Common

Cleavage_site: Gene_id + relative_distance

###Around cleavage sites

e. g.,
Base1_A_-1_1: A nucleotide frequency from -1 to +1 position (relative distance to cleavage sites)

Base2_GA_-4_4:  GA nucleotide frequency from -4 to +4 position (relative distance to cleavage sites)

Codon_AAA_2_2: Codon AAA frequency at +2 position (relative distance to cleavage sites)

Amino_Thr_1_3: Amino acid (Threonine) frequency from +1 to +3 position (relative distance to cleavage sites)

RO_-114_200: ribosome occupancy from -114 to +200 position (relative distance to cleavage sites)

### Whole RNA
e. g.,

last word N: nucleotide, A: amino acid; C codon

From_start_codon: distance from first nucleotide of star codon

Frame: Translation frme

Met_CDS_A: Metionine frequency in CDS region

Leu_CDS_5_end_A: Leucine frequency in 5' end sequence of CDS region (10 amino acid)

AA_5'UTR_5_end: AA nucleotide frequence in 5' end sequence of 5'UTR region (50 nucleotide sequence)

dG_in_cDNA_3_end: Minimum free energy calculated by RNA forl using 3' end sequence of cDNA (whole RNA sequence) (50 nucleotide sequence)
