# LASSO_and_Ridge_regression
Source code and data set in "Feature selection for RNA cleavage efficiency at specific sites using the LASSO regression model in Arabidopsis thaliana"

RNA sequence information can be obtained from TAIR10 database 
(https://www.arabidopsis.org/download/index-auto.jsp?dir=%2Fdownload_files%2FSequences%2FTAIR10_blastsets)

Processed data of clevage efficiencies and ribosome occupancy can be obtained in Dataset
(https://github.com/daishin-ueno/LASSO_and_Ridge_regression/tree/main/Dataset)

Source code for LASSO or Ridge regression model were reffered from sklearn.linear_model.Lasso (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Lasso.html) or sklearn.linear_model.Ridge (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Ridge.html) in Python scikit-learn package.
